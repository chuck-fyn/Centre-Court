# Centre Court

Tennis scorekeeping remotely controlled with just your AirPods. Make any court 'Centre Court' and enjoy a match of tennis scored by an official umpire!

Centre Court is the first app designed for tennis scorekeeping with just your AirPods. Your AirPods act as a remote for scoring points, and as headphones for hearing Centre Court's umpire announce the score. All while your phone stays safe on the sidelines. And most importantly, both players can connect and wear their own pair, so everyone feels like they're playing on 'Centre Court'!
